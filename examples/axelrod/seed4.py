# EVOLVE-BLOCK-START
    """
    This player keeps track of the the opponent's responses to own behavior:

    - `cd_count` counts: Opponent cooperates as response to player defecting.
    - `cc_count` counts: Opponent cooperates as response to player cooperating.

    The player has a defect mode and a normal mode.  In defect mode, the
    player will always defect.  In normal mode, the player obeys the following
    ranked rules:

    1. If in the last three turns, both the player/opponent defected, then
       cooperate for a single turn.
    2. If in the last three turns, the player/opponent acted differently from
       each other and they're alternating, then change next defect to
       cooperate.  (Doesn't block third rule.)
    3. Otherwise, do tit-for-tat.

    Start in normal mode, but every 25 turns starting with the 27th turn,
    re-evaluate the mode.  Enter defect mode if any of the following
    conditions hold:

    - Detected random:  Opponent cooperated 7-18 times since last mode
      evaluation (or start) AND less than 70% of opponent cooperation was in
      response to player's cooperation, i.e.
      cc_count / (cc_count+cd_count) < 0.7
    - Detect defective:  Opponent cooperated fewer than 3 times since last mode
      evaluation.

    When switching to defect mode, defect immediately.  The first two rules for
    normal mode require that last three turns were in normal mode.  When starting
    normal mode from defect mode, defect on first move.
